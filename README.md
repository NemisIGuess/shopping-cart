# Shopping web project

A shopping web made as part of the Odin Project course.

## Features

Landing page with a random selection of products displayed in a layout, a catalogue where you can check
all the products available and a shopping cart where to proceed to checkout.

## Goals of the project

I will learn to use react router and react transitions while working on this project.
Also make the website mobile friendly.
